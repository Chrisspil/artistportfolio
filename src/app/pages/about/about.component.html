    <h1>About the Artist</h1>
    <p>
      Christos Spiliotis was born in the 1980s in an urban environment, but by
      choice, he now resides far from the noise of the city, in a peaceful place
      where mountain and sea coexist in harmony. Following his studies
      (2019–2022), he dedicated himself entirely to his artistic nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      His work reflects both a <b>restless spirit</b> and a
      <b>deeply expressive mind</b>—qualities that permeate his creations. While
      a significant portion of his output is created digitally, it maintains the
      <b>immediacy and soul of hand-drawn expression</b> and traditional
      painting.
    </p>

    <p>
      At 41, Spiliotis has established a <b>strong, distinctive identity</b>,
      confirming that his work is <b>mature</b> and <b>competitive</b> on the
      international stage.
    </p>

    <h1>Artistic Statement</h1>

    <p>
      My approach is <b>Expressive Impressionism</b>, centered on the thematic
      concept of <b>Psychic Topography</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work is defined by the <b>immediacy of the gesture</b>, the thick
      application of paint (impasto), and a dynamic dialogue of materials. My
      art focuses on the <b>deconstruction</b> of space or form, conveying
      <b>internal emotional intensity</b> rather than realistic representation.
    </p>

    <p>Every subject transforms into a <b>landscape of the soul</b>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whether through <b>internal spaces</b> that capture memory or
        anticipation
      </li>
      <li>
        Or through <b>expressive portraits</b> that function as commentary on my
        art (such as Picasso and Mona Lisa)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What remains is the <b>power of emotion</b>-yhe element that drives the
      evolution of he piece
