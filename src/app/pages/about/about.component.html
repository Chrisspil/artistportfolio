    <h1>About the Artist</h1>
    <p>
      Christos Spiliotis was born in the 1980s in an urban environment, but by
      choice, he now resides far from the noise of the city, in a peaceful place
      where mountain and sea coexist in harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following his studies, he dedicated himself entirely to his artistic
      nature. Today, he sketches and paints on any surface, almost all day long.
      His work reflects both a restless spirit and a deeply artistic
      mind—qualities that resonate throughout his creations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology has naturally found its way into his practice as well, with a
      significant number of his works created digitally, yet still retaining the
      immediacy and soul of hand-drawn expression.
    </p>

    <h1>Artistic Statement</h1>

    <p>
      My approach is expressionistic, centered around still lifes and
      spaces—always devoid of human presence. My work is marked by the immediacy
      of the gesture and the interplay of materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each subject is deconstructed, and then reconstructed using only the
      elements essential to its narrative. What remains is what drives the
      evolution of the piece, emotionally and visually.
